      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">In May
2001, I began including a short word </font><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">definition in my e-mail
signature. Every few days, I update my signature to include a new word.
Since I started doing this, many people have asked where the
definitions come from, and could they please have a list of all of the
word's that have appeared in my signature so far. Hence this web page.</font>
      </p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">All of
these definitions come from <i>The Meaning of Liff</i> and <i>The
Deeper Meaning of Liff</i>, both by Douglas Adams and John Lloyd. All
of the words are actually place names, taken mostly from locations in
the UK, but also from the rest of the planet. These place names are
matched with meanings that don't yet have words of their own, usually
with very humorous results.</font> </p>
      <p><font size="-1" face="Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif">The list
below includes all of the words that have appeared in my signature at
the time of writing. I do intend to update this list from time to time,
but if you like this sample, you should probably buy the original books.<br>
